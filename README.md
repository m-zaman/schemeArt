# schemeArt
Here's a scheme interpreter written in python that I wrote for a class at UC Berkeley. I've also included code for a contest winning recursively built art project coded in scheme which you can run through my interpreter.

To run the art generation, run scheme.py with contest.scm as the in line argument in a python 3 environment.
